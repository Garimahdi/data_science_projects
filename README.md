# Data Science Projects
This repository contains my works in some data science project. All of these projects are completed to learn and expand my knowledge about data science and analytics.
All of completed projects use python in form of Jupyter Notebook (ipython notebook).

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
	- Movie Recommender System based on Similarity Function: A model built to show some movie recommendations that is similar to specified movie title based on actors/actress that played in the movie, genre of the movie, directors and writers that were involved in the movie.

	_Libraries in this project: Pandas, Numpy, Sci-kit Learn (CountVectorizer & cosine_similarity)_
	
	- Basic Feature Engineering in Machine Learning using Titanic Dataset: This project explores the basics of feature engineering technique application on pre-processing data before being fitted in the random forest model to predict the survival status of each passenger in RMS Titanic.

	_Libraries in this project: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sci-kit Learn (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, RandomForestClassifier & cross_val_score)_
	
- ### Data Visualization
	- Data Analysis of COVID-19 Case in East Java: Finding reason behind high death rate from COVID-19 in East Java compared to Indonesia, the analysis involved various data visualzation techniques.
